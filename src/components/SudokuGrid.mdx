# Grid

The Grid component currently handles the most of the logic for rendering the Cells.  
Since `SudokuCell` is a functional component, all of the props that the cell requires are passed to it via the Grid component.

## State

The `state` has two objects:

- a 2D array of `cells` objects which contain `value` and `selected` properties
- a `cursorLocation` object containing `row` and `col` properties

## Cell Selection

The cell selection ought to be intuitive to anyone who has used spreadsheets before.

### Single Click

Using the left mouse button to click will:

- move the cursor to the new cell
- deselect all cells then select the new cell

### [CTRL] + Click

Using the left mouse button + `[CTRL]` to click will:

- move the cursor to the new cell
- append the new cell to the other selected cell(s)

### [SHIFT] + Click

Using the left mouse button + `[SHIFT]` to click will:

- keep the cursor at its current location
- deselect all cells and then...
- ...select all cells within the corners of the cursor and the new cell
