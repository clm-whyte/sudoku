# Cell

In standard Sudoku, the grid is made up of 81 **cells** in a 9x9 square (9 rows and 9 columns).  
The **cells** are arranged into 3x3 sections called **boxes**, which are outlined in bold.

## Default

By default, a cell is has no value, is unselected and has a thin grey outline.  
The cells are **Material UI** Buttons which have been restyled using some Sassy CSS.

```css
.sudokuCell {
  max-width: 34px;
  max-height: $cellSize;
  min-width: 34px;
  min-height: $cellSize;
  border: $cellBorder;
  border-radius: 0;
  background-color: white;
  color: navy;
}
```

<Preview>
  <Story id="cell--empty" />
</Preview>

## Position

A cell's position in the grid determines its outline.  
If it's in the first row/column, it will have a thick top/left border respectively.  
Otherwise, every 3rd row/column is given a thick bottom/right border, based on the following lines of code:

```javascript
${props.col % 3 === 2 ? "boxBoundaryRight" : ""}
${props.row % 3 === 2 ? "boxBoundaryBottom" : ""}
```

  <Story id="cell--outer-corner" />
  <Story id="cell--inner-corner" />
</Preview>

## Selection

By default a cell is unselected.  
An unselected cell has a white background and may or may not be filled with a value.

A selected cell is denoted by a pink background colour.

## Cursor

There can be only one "cursor" Cell on the grid.  
The cursor shows the current position of the "active" cell. By default, this is at position `0, 0` and unselected.

  <Story id="cell--empty" />
  <Story id="cell--cursor" />
  <Story id="cell--cursor-and-selected" />
</Preview>

## Value

The cell values default to a value of `null`.
